TASK:
    Build a novel extension for 1inch Cross-chain Swap (Fusion+) that enables swaps between Ethereum and ICP
    Qualification Requirements
    Requirements:
    - Preserve hashlock and timelock functionality for the non-EVM implementation
    - Swap functionality should be bidirectional (swaps should be possible to and from Ethereum)
    - Onchain (mainnet or testnet) execution of token transfers should be presented during the final demo
    Stretch goals (not hard requirements):
    - UI
    - Enable partial fills
    - Relayer and resolver
